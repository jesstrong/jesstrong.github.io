            <img src="./images/JESportfolio2 - Copy.jpg" alt="JESpic" class="center">
            <p>&nbsp; Welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Janet Strong and I have successfully completed certification as a full-stack C# software developer at We Can Code It Bootcamp, Cleveland, OH location. My past experience comes from several different sectors of the manufacturing industry holding positions at senior level management: operations to controller and various levels of account manager type positions.</p>
            <br> 
            <p>&nbsp; I decided to transition into the software development field for a love of detail, curiosity and tenacity for working through a situation or problem until an answer is found. I thrive on a challenge, trying to understand why something works the way it does and being hands on within an active team environment to reach that goal or find the solution to that problem!</p>
