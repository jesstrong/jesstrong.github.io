            <img src="./images/JESportfolio3 - Copy.jpg" alt="JESpic" class="center">
            <p>&nbsp; Welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Janet Strong and I have successfully completed certification as a full-stack C# software developer at We Can Code It Bootcamp, Cleveland, OH location. My past experience comes from several different sectors of the manufacturing industry holding positions at senior level management: operations to controller and various levels of account manager type positions.</p>
            <br> 
            <p>&nbsp; I transitioned into the software development field for a love of detail, curiosity and tenacity for working through a situation or problem until an answer is found. I thrive on a challenge, trying to understand why something works the way it does and being hands on within an active team environment to reach that goal or find the solution to that problem!</p>

                            </a>
                            <p>This project was designed and implemented by a team of six students, including myself. It is a single page web application separating the content seen by regular users vs. administrators. Project started out as in .NET MVC but for the flexibility, we created the frontend structured in Node.js and backend structured in C#. The app, Studio Access Ally, is an inventory management system made for any recording studio.</p>
